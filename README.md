# Simple Neural Net
This is a simple neural network, implemented from scratch. Following Andrej Karpathy's tutorial, we create a value class, then a nueron, layer, and finally a network. 

## Future Steps
- Implement more complex optimizers than the most basic version of gradient descent
- Train on a real (but simple) dataset from kaggle
